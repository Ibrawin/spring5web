Spring Web Applcation

This is a prepopulated database that uses JPA to persist POJOs into an in memory H2 database. A controller is also used so we can use the urls /books and /authors to view parts of the books and authors objects as a view using thymeleaf to render it.

You can view the web page by visiting either:
http://localhost:8080/books/
http://localhost:8080/authors/

You can view the in-memory H2 database by visiting:
http://localhost:8080/h2-console
