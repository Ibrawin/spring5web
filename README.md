Spring Web Application

This is a pre-populated database that uses JPA to persist POJOs into an in memory H2 database. A controller is also used so we can use the urls /books and /authors to view parts of the books and authors objects as a view using thymeleaf to render it.

This contains:
* Java
* HTML
* CSS
* SQL

With the support of:
* Spring Web
* Data JPA
* Thymeleaf
* Hibernate
* H2 Database

You can view the web page by visiting either:
http://localhost:8080/books/ or http://localhost:8080/authors/
Note: The data and css won't be rendered by opening up the HTML file alone. The application needs to be run first!

You can view the in-memory H2 database by visiting:
http://localhost:8080/h2-console
